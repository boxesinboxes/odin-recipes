I will be constructing my first website through HTML. 
This is a basic website that won't look pretty.
But I will have used knowledge I have gathered over the course to create it. 
This includes the basic fundamentals of website coding and structure. 
Some of those components include header and the body. 
But I am having trouble uploading these pages to github.
